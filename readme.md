# HitMarkers

Hit and kill markers will display as enemies take damage from the player. Included are a variety of impact sounds from several popular shooters. Visuals can also be toggled off, allowing this to function as an audio-only add-on. Other options include style tweaks, color switching, volume controls, fade out timing, and individual hit/kill sound effects.
